# LESA Technical Specification
### Legal Engineering Standards Association (LESA)

This repository hosts the formal technical specification being developed by the **Legal Engineering Standards Association (LESA)**, under the **Community Specification License 1.0**.

---

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to serve as the authoritative source for the *Signet* technical standard being developed by LESA. The specification defines normative requirements, models, and interfaces that enable consistent, interoperable, and verifiable implementations of legal engineering processes, data structures, and technologies.

The work aims to ensure interoperability and alignment between legal, regulatory, and computational systems—establishing a common foundation for legal-tech innovation.

## License

This project and all its materials are made available under the **Community Specification License 1.0 (CSL 1.0)**.

The Community Specification has been developed via the [Joint Development Foundation](http://www.jointdevelopment.org), with inspiration from the [Open Web Foundation agreements](http://openwebfoundation.org) and the [Alliance for Open Media Patent License 1.0](http://aomedia.org/license/patent-license/).

## Implementation Guidance

The specification defines concepts, structures, and conformance requirements without prescribing implementation technology.  
Implementers are encouraged to:

- Identify required and optional compliance levels.  
- Refer to accompanying open source reference implementations.  
- Report interoperability feedback through GitHub Issues.  
- Participate in community discussions during review cycles.
