# Legal Engineering Standards Association Governance Policy 1.0

This document provides the governance policy for specification and other documents developed by the Legal Engineering Standards Association ("the Association") using the Community Specification process.

## 1.	Roles.

The Association includes the following roles:

**1.1.	Maintainer.** “Maintainers” are responsible for organizing activities around developing, maintaining, and updating the specification(s) developed by the Association.  Maintainers are also responsible for determining consensus and coordinating appeals.  The Association will designate one or more Maintainers.  The Association may select a new or additional Maintainer(s) upon Approval of the Association Participants.  

**1.2.	Editor.**  “Editors” are responsible for ensuring that the contents of the document accurately reflect the decisions that have been made by the group, and that the specification adheres to formatting and content guidelines. The Association will designate an Editor.  The Association may select a new Editor upon Approval of the Association Participants.

**1.3.	Participants.**  “Participants” are those that have made Contributions to the Association subject to the Community Specification License.

## 2.	Decision Making.

**2.1.	Consensus-Based Decision Making.**  The Association makes decisions through a consensus process (“Approval” or “Approved”).  While the agreement of all Participants is preferred, it is not required for consensus.  Rather, the Maintainer will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Association Participants and nature of support and objections.  The Maintainer will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements. 

**2.2.	Appeal Process.**  Decisions may be appealed via a pull request or an issue, and that appeal will be considered by the Maintainer in good faith, who will respond in writing within a reasonable time.

## 3.	Ways of Working.

Inspired by [ANSI’s Essential Requirements for Due Process](https://www.ansi.org/american-national-standards/ans-introduction/essential-requirements), the Association adheres to consensus-based due process requirements.  These requirements apply to activities related to the development of consensus for approval, revision, reaffirmation, and withdrawal of the agreements data standard specification.  Due process means that any person (organization, company, government agency, individual, etc.) with a direct and material interest has a right to participate by: a) expressing a position and its basis, b) having that position considered, and c) having the right to appeal. Due process allows for equity and fair play. The following constitute the minimum acceptable due process requirements for the development of consensus.

**3.1.	Openness.**  Participation shall be open to all persons who are directly and materially affected by the activity in question. There shall be no undue financial barriers to participation. Voting membership on the consensus body shall not be conditional upon membership in any organization, nor unreasonably restricted on the basis of technical qualifications or other such requirements.

**3.2.	Lack of Dominance.**  The development process shall not be dominated by any single interest category, individual or organization. Dominance means a position or exercise of dominant authority, leadership, or influence by reason of superior leverage, strength, or representation to the exclusion of fair and equitable consideration of other viewpoints.

**3.3.	Balance.**  The development process should have a balance of interests. Participants from diverse interest categories shall be sought with the objective of achieving balance.

**3.4.	Coordination and Harmonization.**  Good faith efforts shall be made to resolve potential conflicts between and among deliverables developed under the Association and existing industry standards.

**3.5.	Consideration of Views and Objections.**  Prompt consideration shall be given to the written views and objections of all Participants.

**3.6.	Written procedures.**  This governance document and other materials documenting the Association's development process shall be available to any interested person.

## 4.	Specification Development Process.  

**4.1.	Pre-Draft.**  Any Participant may submit a proposed initial draft document as a candidate Draft Specification of the Association.  The Maintainer will designate each submission as a “Pre-Draft” document.

**4.2.	Draft.**  Each Pre-Draft document must first be Approved to become a ”Draft Specification”.  Once the Association approves a document as a Draft Specification, the Draft Specification becomes the basis for all going forward work on that specification.

**4.3.	Association Approval.**  Once the Association believes it has achieved the objectives for its specification as described in the Scope, it will Approve that Draft Specification and progress it to “Approved Specification” status. 

**4.4.	Publication and Submission.**  Upon the designation of a Draft Specification as an Approved Specification, the Maintainer will publish the Approved Specification in a manner agreed upon by the Association Participants (i.e., Association Participant only location, publicly available location, Association maintained website, Association member website, etc.).  The publication of an Approved Specification in a publicly accessible manner must include the terms under which the Approved Specification is being made available under.

**4.5.	Submissions to Standards Bodies.**  No Draft Specification or Approved Specification may be submitted to another standards development organization without Association Approval. Upon reaching Approval, the Maintainer will coordinate the submission of the applicable Draft Specification or Approved Specification to another standards development organization. Association Participants that developed that Draft Specification or Approved Specification agree to grant the copyright rights necessary to make those submissions.

## 5. Non-Confidential, Restricted Disclosure.

Information disclosed in connection with any Association activity, including but not limited to meetings, Contributions, and submissions, is not confidential, regardless of any markings or statements to the contrary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Association is collaborating via a private repository, the Participants will not make any public disclosures of that information contained in that private repository without the Approval of the Association.
