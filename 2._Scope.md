# Scope

This document describes what is — and is not — covered by the Agreements Data Standard under development by the Legal Engineering Standards Association (LESA), drawing on the prior *Signet Data Standard*. It clarifies the boundaries, intended use cases, and limitations of the standard.  

---

## What the Standard Covers

The Agreements Data Standard:

1. **Data Model for Legal Agreements**  
   Specifies a structured schema / ontology for representing legal agreements and their components, including but not limited to parties, signatures, dates, governing law, clauses, obligations, metadata (e.g. versioning, amendments), identifiers.  

2. **Standardised Metadata**  
   Defines a set of common metadata fields to capture essential information about agreements: who the parties are, when the agreement is effective, when it expires, revision history, jurisdiction, and other background data.  

3. **Interoperability**  
   Explores how different legal tech tools, document management systems, and workflows to exchange, validate, and process agreements data in a consistent way.

4. **Governance & Versioning**  
   Lays out the rules for evolving the standard: how new fields or types are added; how deprecation works; how backwards compatibility is maintained.  

5. **Templates & Examples**  
   Provides templates, example data instances, and guidance to help implementers adopt the standard in their systems.

6. **Legal Agreements in Scope**  
   Applies to formal written agreements (contracts, MoUs, NDAs etc.), including their amendments, annexes/schedules, signatures, and any legally relevant attachments.

## What the Standard Does *Not* Cover

1. **Non-Legal Documents**  
   Documents that are not legal agreements (e.g. informal communications, internal memos, drafts without legal effect) are out of scope unless explicitly converted into legal agreements under the standard.

2. **Full Legal Semantics or Automated Reasoning**  
   While clause types may be identified, the standard does not aim (at least in initial releases) to encode full legal semantics, resolve ambiguities, or decide enforceability.  

3. **Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements**  
   The standard aims to be jurisdiction-agnostic where possible. It does not embed or enforce specific legal requirements from any one country’s contract law, but it encourages implementers to record jurisdictional metadata and observe local law outside the standard.

4. **Signature Infrastructure**  
   The standard will record signature data (who signed, when, how, etc.) but it does **not** itself provide or regulate digital signature infrastructure or its legal compliance (e.g. PKI, certificate authorities) — that is for the implementer or external protocol.

5. **Policy / Enforcement of Agreements**  
   The standard does not deal with enforcement, dispute resolution, or policy compliance beyond providing the data structure to represent relevant data.  

6. **Highly Confidential or Sensitive Provisions / Encryption**  
   While data privacy, confidentiality, and security are concerns for implementers, the standard does not prescribe encryption schemes or secure storage; those are implementation details outside its normative scope.

## Intended Users / Use Cases

The standard is designed for:

- Legal engineers building agreements tools or looking to embed lightweight agreements into their apps.
- Developers that wish to present a way to lightweight agreements to be made as efficiently and frictionlessly as possible.  
- Standards bodies, auditors, or regulatory projects needing consistent contract data representations.
- Developers that wish to use a data standard for agreements that can be written onchain or to a content-addressable-storage layer.

## Boundaries / Limitations

- **Version 1.x** is expected to cover a core subset of fields and agreement types; not all possible clause types or edge cases will be covered initially.  
- Backwards compatibility will be prioritised, but early versions may need migrations.  
- Implementation details (data storage, APIs, schema formats — JSON, RDF, XML etc.) are outside normative specification, though guidance may be provided.
